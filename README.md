# OneQode Website

This is the previous version of the OneQode website, built in the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator and hosted with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

To get started,

```npm install```

then

```npx @11ty/eleventy --serve --quiet```

This will launch a local version of the site at https://localhost:8080/.

If you change and save a file, the build process will instantly rerun, and your browser will refresh right away.

Once youâ€™re happy with your changes, update the main branch and push to Github. Netlify will then rebuild the live site and it will be updated within 1 minute.

Any questions, ask me (Joe).
