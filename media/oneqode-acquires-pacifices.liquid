<p>For OneQode this means access to an existing customer base of players who value high-performance networks and will feel right at home on the OneQode cloud.</p>

<p>Players in Asia-Pacific using PacificES will be able to leverage OneQode's high-performance cloud compute and unique APAC Central backbone for community servers in titles such as Counter Strike: Global Offensive, Team Fortress 2, Minecraft, and more.</p>
