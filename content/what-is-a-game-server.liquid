						<h2>What is a game server?</h2>
						<p><strong>A game server is a computer that acts as a central authority to define the current state of a multiplayer game.</strong></p>
						<p>Players send the server updates about what they’re doing in-game — and the server processes all inputs, settles inconsistencies, and transmits regular updates to players, providing a stream of snapshots of all elements in the game.</p>
						<img src="/img/content/what-is-a-game-server/game-server-players-hand-drawn-illustration.png" alt="A hand drawn diagram with a game server in the middle, connected to players on the outside, each sending and receiving data to the server" class="my-4">
						<p>A game server is both the stadium where the game is played — and it’s also the referee.</p>
						<p>If you’re playing a game, when you jump, your computer tells that to the server, and the server tells everyone else that you’re in the air.</p>
						<p>So how does everyone know what in-game “reality” is?</p>
						<p>To explain, we need to cover two key concepts: game state and tickrate.</p>
						<!-- Game State -->
						<h2 class="mt-4" id="game-state">Game state: the single source of truth</h2>
						<p><strong>The game state (or “tick”) is a snapshot in time of the properties of every object in the game world.</strong></p>
						<!-- Wide Image -->

						<!-- End Wide Image -->
						<p>With lots of players doing things at the same time, often in close proximity in-game, a server has to keep track of what happens and when — to make sure everyone’s on the same page.</p>
						<p>When the game state is calculated, the server transmits it to each connected player’s device — after this, each player’s game world is refreshed.</p>
						<p>And this happens many times each second.</p>
						<!-- Tickrate -->
						<h2 class="mt-4" id="tickrate">Tickrate: the frequency of game state updates</h2>
						<p><strong>Tickrate is the number of times an updated game state is calculated and broadcast by a game server to players every second.</strong></p>
						<p>The higher the tickrate, the more precise a game simulation is.</p>
						<p>If a server sends 64 updates to players each second, it’s referred to as a “64-tick”, or “64 Hz” server (because Hertz, or Hz, is the unit of frequency).</p>
						<p>Here’s what that looks like in action:</p>
						<h3 class="mt-4">Visualising a 64-tick server</h3>

						<h3 class="mt-4">Visualising a 32-tick server</h3>
						<p>Compare that with a 32-tick server, which sends updates half as often:</p>

						</figure>
					</div>
					<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
						<!-- End Wide Image -->
						<h3 class="mt-4">What tickrate means for gamers</h3>
						<p>When more game states are calculated every second, more movement and action can be accounted for — so a higher tickrate produces <strong>a more precise, high-fidelity gaming experience</strong>.</p>
						<p>That means split-second actions in the game can be factored in — and it can make the difference between life or death in-game — especially in a first-person shooter.</p>
						<h3 class="mt-4">When does tickrate matter?</h3>
						<p>Not all games need game servers with a high tickrate.</p>
						<p>Turn-based games, like Hearthstone, don’t need a high tickrate since the game does not update multiple times a second.</p>
						<p>Real-time games like DOTA, Counter-Strike, or Valorant do need higher tickrates to maintain synchronised game states.</p>
						<p>Games with real-time action usually feature higher-tickrate servers (64 or 128-tick) for the best gameplay experience.</p>
						<h3 class="mt-4">How does tickrate affect a game server?</h3>
						<p>As tickrate increases, more processing power and data transmission is required.</p>
						<p>When you double the tickrate from 32 to 64 ticks, you <strong>increase the load</strong> on the server, as players send data more frequently, and the server needs to calculate the game state more often.</p>
						<p>So <strong>to game on a high tick server, the server needs to be fast</strong> enough to handle the extra workload.</p>
						<!-- Hardware -->
						<h2 class="mt-4" id="hardware">What type of hardware is in a game server?</h2>
						<h3>Dedicated game servers</h3>
						<p>A dedicated game server is the most common type of game server.</p>
						<p>Under the hood, a dedicated game server is a powerful computer designed to be run 24/7. Like any other computer, it features a motherboard, CPU (processor), RAM (memory for short-term storage), power supply, fans, and a case.</p>

					<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
						<!-- End Wide Image — With Caption -->
						<p>The single <strong>most important component in a game server is the CPU</strong>, which processes all the data in an online game.</p>
						<p>By having a faster CPU, a game server can run more calculations every second — so it can handle higher tickrate gaming workloads.</p>
						<p>While processing data is important, a game server is also <strong>optimised for high-throughput network connectivity</strong>. Because lots of people connect and send data to the server, a game server will typically have a powerful network card (or cards) to support lots of simultaneous connections.</p>
						<h3 class="mt-4">Peer-to-Peer game servers</h3>
						<p>Peer-to-peer game servers are less common — and games that use it have fewer concurrent players in a match (e.g. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate).</p>
						<p>In peer-to-peer games, the <strong>game assigns one player’s device to also host the match</strong>, so that players’ device runs the server in the background, while the player is also playing on the same device.</p>

						<p>While peer-to-peer games are cheaper for the developers (as they don’t have to buy dedicated servers), it usually isn’t great for players.</p>
						<p>Running both the game client and game server can be taxing — and if the “host” player has a bad internet connection, it can be a bad experience for everyone in the game.</p>
						<h2 class="mt-4">Where are game servers located?</h2>
						<p class="fail mt-8">Both peer-to-peer and hosting from a home computer use one player’s home network.</p>
						<p>Which means everyone relies on home internet of the host.</p>
						<p>In peer-to-peer, the networking will attempt the best connection, but the host’s location can skew the ping to the advantage of certain players.</p>
						<p>Servers that are run from data centres have a lot of benefits over these two kinds of hosting.</p>
						<p>Most importantly: they are designed for and built with hosting multiplayer games in mind.</p>
						<p>The best experience for gamers is either dedicated servers from the developer or hosting their own dedicated server in a data centre. </p>
						<p>But the connection to these servers isn’t instant. The time between your information being sent to the server, and the server being able to respond is called ping.</p>

						<h2 class="mt-4 fail">How does game server hosting work?</h2>
						<h2 class="mt-4">How game servers receive data and resolve differences</h2>
						<h3 class="mt-4">The ways to send data to a server</h3>
						<p class="fail">https://gafferongames.com/post/introduction_to_networked_physics/</p>
						<p class="fail">https://ruoyusun.com/2019/03/28/game-networking-1.html</p>
						<p>There are three ways data can be sent to synchronise the game state.</p>
						<p>The first way that the state might be updated is by ‘sending state’.</p>
						<h4>What is Sending State?</h4>
						<p>This is a high network traffic method of updating the various players of the game state.</p>
						<p>With every player sending constant updates, this design means that these games are more difficult to cheat in.</p>
						<p> The second method for updating the state is less common for dedicated gaming servers and that is ‘sending input’.</p>
						<h4>What is Sending Input?</h4>
						<p>Sending input works by only communicating what each player is attempting to do on their end, keeping file sizes smaller.</p>
						<p>This is easier to fake on your local computer, so these games are more susceptible to cheating.</p>
						<h4>What is Client State?</h4>
						<p>A more common networking method is updated client state. Updated client state only sends information regarding the differences, which is less data than the entire game state.</p>
						<p>This works by rewinding to the state that the server sent and then tracking the difference between the two.</p>
						<p>All of these networking options work towards the same goal: ensuring all players have the correct version of the game state.</p>
						<h3 class="mt-4">How does a game server resolve differences in data?</h3>
						<p>Let’s say you’re playing a first person shooter. You’re aiming at an enemy, and they’re aiming at you. You both shoot.</p>
						<p>Both players’ devices send the command to the server — and whoever’s data gets to the server first is likely to be processed first and broadcast to all players.</p>
						<p>So for a player, your latency to the server can  really can make the difference between life and death.</p>
						<p>There’s a lot of clever code that happens behind the scenes to process this. To learn more about how multiplayer games sync their state, check out this great <a href="https://medium.com/@qingweilim/how-do-multiplayer-games-sync-their-state-part-1-ab72d6a54043" rel="noopener">series on state synchronisation</a> by Qing Wei Lim.</p>
						<h2 class="mt-4 fail">STUFF</h2>
						<p>In a multiplayer game, two players seeing different versions of the game can cause problems.</p>
						<p class="fail">When you duck behind cover in Counter-Strike or Call of Duty — only to be shot from an angle that is seemingly impossible — that’s the fault of the server desynchronising.</p>
						<p class="fail">A synchronised game state means that people can land headshots and play as intended, whereas a desynchronised game will have them sending angry emails instead.</p>
						<h2 class="mt-4">Where are game servers located?</h2>
						<p>A game server can be anywhere, including on your desk, if developers release server binaries.</p>
						<p>A server binary is an executable software that runs the game server. In essence, the server binary is the program that runs the game world, while your version of the multiplayer game sends information to it.</p>
						<p>Hosting games with a server binary on a computer in your home turns your computer into the host. </p>
						<p>Many games that release the binary and server software have long life spans and increased control given to the players. Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike, and Minecraft are examples of popular games that give more control to players who host their own servers.</p>
						<p>If a developer does release the server binary, those can then be hosted from the home computer or a data centre, the key technical difference being speed and location.</p>
						<p>Some people use an old PC to run servers. But not everyone has the processing power or hardware required to run multiplayer computer games.</p>
						<h2>What is a private dedicated gaming server?</h2>
						<p>A private dedicated server is when an individual player sets up, either locally or at a data centre, a private server.</p>
						<p>While many gamers enjoy playing on public servers, there are several advantages to setting up a private server. Whether it is a local or remote server, running your own game server will have benefits. </p>
						<p>When starting the server setup process the first step is to choose what specific game you’re going to be hosting on the dedicated game server.</p>
						<p>Private server software means you can configure your game to have more control over who can join the game, moderation tools, and even mod support.</p>
						<p>Depending on what you’re playing, being the host of your own dedicated server means you can prevent players from interfering with your progress while you’re offline, or griefing other players.</p>
						<p>Whether choosing a server provider, using a separate PC to host locally, or running the dedicated server and game on the same computer, there is also increased control over the hardware in private dedicated servers.</p>
						<p>For example, if you need more memory for your dedicated server setup, that’s possible with many providers. If it is your own hardware, you can simply upgrade it.</p>
						<h3 class="mt-4">What is ping, and why is it important for game servers?</h3>
						<p>Ping is the time it takes for data to travel through fibre optic cables between the player and the server. Measured in milliseconds, and often abbreviated to ‘ms’, a low ping is essential to a good gameplay experience.</p>
						<p>All internet connections have a ping, but it is most noticeable in video games.</p>
						<p>Ping can be affected by many elements, but primarily is a result of server location and routing.</p>
						<p>The information travelling from you, and back from the server, is moving at close to the speed of light.</p>
						<p>The hardware that connects players with the server isn’t perfect, which can sometimes cause delays (lag) or even packet loss. If you’ve played any online games where a character seemingly runs infinitely into a wall, before teleporting halfway across the world: that was likely due to packet loss.</p>
						<p>Even when it works perfectly, the information needs to be reflected and repeated along the way as it travels long distances to the server. It will take a pathway through other servers, eventually connecting to you.</p>
						<h4 >What is that pathway called?</h4>
						<p>The pathway chosen for the data is called routing. Poor routing will send data along inefficient pathways, increasing the ping. Good routing sends data along the most direct pathway, connecting players and servers more efficiently.</p>

						</figure>
					</div>
					<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
						<p>Routing can make or break a player’s ping</p>
						<p>In a nutshell: poor routing and distant servers will create high pings and unplayable matches.</p>
						<h3>What makes gaming servers unique?</h3>
						<p>Fundamentally game servers are very similar to the rest of the internet.</p>
						<p>Everything on the internet functions through similar servers, albeit less powerful ones.</p>
						<p>Now that you have the introduction to gaming servers, you know how they work and the terminology to understand their unique performance requirements.</p>
						<h3>Any other terms I should know about game servers?</h3>
						<p class="fail">In networking terminology, game servers are the hosts, with the players connecting being the clients.</p>
						<p>There is no shortage of server terminology, here are some common words and phrases that will help you understand game servers.</p>
						<h4>Uptime</h4>
						<p>Uptime is whether or not the server is accessible and connected to the internet. Servers will go ‘down’, generally due to either scheduled maintenance or a denial of service attack (DDoS).</p>
						<p>A server hosted on a home computer will also go down if the computer is turned off.</p>
						<p>Server providers may provide uptime guarantees, which is a <em>claim</em> that you will be able to gain access to the game server 99%, 99.9%, or 100% of the time. Effectively, the uptime guarantee keeps you in game.</p>
						<h4>Denial of service (DoS) attacks and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks</h4>
						<p>Both of these malicious attacks are designed to prevent usage by overwhelming a server with illegitimate requests.</p>
						<p>DoS attacks focus on the endpoints rather than trying to disrupt a whole network, whereas DDoS attacks target the network as a whole.</p>
						<h4>Game Client</h4>
						<p>Game clients is a fancy term for the game itself. If you’ve launched a game on your gaming PC or console, it is running the “game client”.</p>
