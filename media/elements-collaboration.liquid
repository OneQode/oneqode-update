<p>OneQode, the high-performance cloud and network provider, and <a href="https://www.getelements.dev/" target="_blank">Elements</a>, a next-generation server engine for game developers, are pleased to announce a strategic partnership targeted at the game industry.</p>

<p>By offering a &quot;<em>backend in a box</em>,&quot; Elements enables game developers to save costs significantly. With Elements, there&#39;s no need to hire a full devops team or manage scaling and load balancing. This allows developers to focus on crafting their game codes without being weighed down by backend complications, thereby making game projects more viable and drastically reducing production time.</p>
<p>With the support of OneQode, Elements will be offering game developers access to low-latency, high-performance cloud infrastructure. Thanks to OneQode&#39;s standout features – exceptional compute performance, a unique latency-optimised network and a new &#39;APAC Central&#39; cloud region that can cater to over half of the global population from one location – game developers using Elements can leverage an unrivalled cloud platform, ideal for their multiplayer game development needs.</p>
<p>&quot;OneQode is excited to provide the foundational infrastructure for Elements. Their platform has the potential to reduce game production time and simplify the game development process&quot; said Matt Shearing, CEO of OneQode. &quot;This partnership aligns with our mission to build the foundation for the next decade of connected experiences, and we are excited to be part of it.&quot;</p>
<p>Patrick Twohig, CEO of Elements, shared the sentiment. He stated, &quot;Partnering with OneQode means developers using Elements can reach large gaming markets on high-performance infrastructure, giving our users the best experience possible. We’ve built a game-changing backend service for developers, and we’re excited to see where this partnership takes us.&quot;</p>
<p>Both companies look forward to expanding their partnership and delivering a better experience for game developers and gamers across the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.</p>
